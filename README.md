# 📦 Data Management with Objects, Sets, and Maps in JavaScript
This project demonstrates how to manage data using advanced JavaScript structures such as Objects, Sets, and Maps. Through a practical example involving technology products, key operations such as duplicate removal, categorization, and traversal of data structures are performed.

## 🚀 Features

1. Creation of an object called products containing 6 products, each with an id, name, and price.

2. Elimination of duplicate products by name using a Set.

3. Association of categories to products using a Map structure.

4. Looping through each structure:

    for...in for objects.

    for...of for Sets.

    forEach for Maps.

5. Input, output, and test messages printed to the console to validate system operation.

## 🛠️ Technologies used
Language: JavaScript (ES6)

Execution environment: Console (e.g., Node.js or browser)

## 📂 Code Structure

products: Object with products and their properties.

setProducts: Set that eliminates duplicates by name.

mapProducts: Map that relates categories to product names.

Several loops to display and validate data in the console.

## 💻 How to run it

1. Copy the code into a .js file.

2. Open it in an environment like Node.js or paste it into your browser's console.

3. View the console output to see how the information is handled.

## ✅ Expected result

Complete visualization of the original object.

List of unique product names.

Clear relationship between categories and products.

Final proof showing all structures.
